File System Plan:
=================

The rootdir contains a directory ".META". Say file system currenltly stores
n distinct blocks. Consider a single block with SHA1 hash `h`. Corresponding
to this block one has two files in ".META":

	`h.data` is a file spanning a block and stores the actual block data
	`h.meta` is a file storing auxillary data like number of references to this block

Say we have a file in filesystem named `myfile.txt`
Actual contents of `myfile.txt` on disk will be:
	N_BLOCKS
	SIZE
	BLOCK1 (each of these values is nothing but hash value)
	BLOCK2
	.
	.
	.
	.
This structure of file will be read up by our filesystem and handled appropriately.
Directories are stored in usual way


* We clean the rootdir upon initialization. to make stuff easier.

* Lets try and use the following code for SHA1 - https://github.com/clibs/sha1
  Its well documented and will simpplify our work to a great deal.
